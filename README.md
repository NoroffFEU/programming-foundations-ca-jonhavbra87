# Programming Foundations CA (Xbox controllers)

My objects has the following properties:

- Brand (String), the manufacturer of the controller
- Price (Number), the price of the product
- Colour (String), the colour of the product
- Features (Array), the list of properties of the controller
- Poweron (Boolean), checks if the controller is on or of
- Functions, I got a cople of functions in my xboxcontroller.js file.

Info:
I have tried to fetch data from a data.json file, and used that to create a website using only JavaScript. I have used som basic styling (same as teacher showed us on lecture week 39).

I have problemsolved the img of the controllers by myself and chatGPT.

The buttons in the nav is created by ChatGPT, because I did not manage to create them by myself.
